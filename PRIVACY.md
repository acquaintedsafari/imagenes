# Privacy Policy
This document outlines the information collected and used in this app. This aims to provide a clearer picture as to how Imagenes operates and what you can do about it.

## What is collected?
By nature, this app requires you to sign in to your Google account. This data may be stored inside of a browser cookie, which is required for automatic sign-on in this application. This data is stored locally.

Imagenes does not collect data for itself and does not send any data to the developer. However, Google may collect data from you; this information is outlined in Google's privacy policy.

## Why is this data collcted?
Imagenes is an Electron-based app, meaning that it uses web technologies. This app is designed to be a native wrapper for Google Photos and nothing else. Google's data collection policies still apply, and no other data is collected.

If there is any data that is collected that wasn't collected by Google, it is discarded. (Really, I don't need your data!)
